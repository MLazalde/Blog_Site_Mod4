## Blog Site

# Link to the Site

[My First Blog](https://mlazalde.github.io/Blog_Site_Mod4/index.html)

# Description:

This blog site will allow you to enter blog entries and have you put your username, blog title, and comments be shown on a different page showing the history of your previous blog entries. 

The landing page and blog page will both provide you with a toggle to control Dark mode in the form of a small sun in the top corner. 

The application makes use of an HTML, CSS, and JS file. 

## How to use:

1. On the initial landing page, you will see a title image on the left and three entry fields on the left.
2. Fill out each text field with the corresponding User, Blog Post Title, and your Comments. Failure to fill any of the fields with text will result in an error message. 
3. Once you hit submit, you will be taken to a new page where your past blog entries will be listed, with the newest entry at the bottom.
4. You can hit the button at the top left, next to the sun, to return to the previous page and input a new entry. 

# To enable the Dark/Light mode:

- Click on the little sun at the top right of the left of the screen. This will create a dark background and change the text to be readable on the darker background.
